title: The Dawn Before SBHacks
---

So tomorrow I'll be going to [SBHacks](http://www.ucsbhacks.com/), a hackathon at Santa Barbara.
It's been years since I've been to Santa Barbara. I had some of my best
memories there when I was younger. Now, years later, I'm going back to
make more memories. These dev events I've been going to lately have been
great! Not only are they fun, but I end up learning a ton at each one I
go to. The last few days, I've been preparing by getting my feet wet
with different dev stacks including [Parse](https://parse.com/) and [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/).

The event seems to have a lot of different categories to choose from and
I don't really want to get tied to a particular idea or technology. Looking
at these different dev stacks has helped me open my eyes a bit to other
types of software dev and the approach to creating them. I've done a
heavy amount of gamedev these last few years and I want to branch out to
see what's out there. That is why at these hackathons I attend, I look
to make something that doesn't fall in the category of a game.

Over five hundred people are expected to attend this event, so I'm
hoping to meet a lot of interesting people!
