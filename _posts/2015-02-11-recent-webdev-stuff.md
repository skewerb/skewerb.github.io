title: Recent Webdev Stuff
---

So I've been reallyyy into webdev this past week. Like *really* into it. Every single day this week
I've been learning more and more about different web technologies. I feel like the
[Blast Zone Studios](http://blastzonestudios.com) website will soon become a sort of
frankenstein-like project that'll include all the stuff I've picked up recently. I suppose it
isn't too bad initially as the site is still pretty bare-bones.

As for this blog, I'm definitely going to be updating it with a new dev stack. I realized the foundation
I laid out for this blog isn't where it should be. The biggest issue is that it still isn't
optimized for mobile. Well, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) will fix it!
