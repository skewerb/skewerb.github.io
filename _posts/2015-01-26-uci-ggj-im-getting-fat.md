title: UCI GGJ - I'm Getting Fat
---

So this past weekend, I attended the Global Gamejam hosted at [UCI](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/jam-sites/uc-irvine). It was
incredibly fun! It was great working with people who all shared the same interest
in making games. Everyone had their own ideas to contribute and by the end of it,
we were able to come up with [something pretty great](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/robot-rescue). It was a lot of work making
the game, but it didn't feel like work. I'm going to continue going to these events
because the insights I've gained have been invaluble. However, theres a huge concern
I have for attending these things - my health.

I try to be generally health-conscious. I go to the gym a few days a week. My diet
is okay-ish. And I sleep an adequate amount everyday. But when I go to these events
I completely disregard my normal habits. If I see snacks and soda laid out on the
counters, I grab them. When I'm deep into development and am low on sleep, I
just want something tasty to keep myself going. I understand that I don't require
these things to function, but they are just so freakin' tempting to eat! Lack of
sleep and binge eating is fine once in a blue moon, but since I've commited to going
to more of these events, I absolutely need to keep myself in check.

At UCI's GGJ I was able to get about 5 hours of sleep a night, which is much better
then I previously got before, but I ate a ton. I think I had about four sodas per day
plus a countless amount of chips and candy. It is really starting to show as well.
I definitely have a belly. I'm getting fat.

So from this day forth, I am eating healthy at these developer events. Unless theres
[Reeses](http://www.hersheys.com/reeses/). I love Reeses.
