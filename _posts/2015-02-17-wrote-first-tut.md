title: Wrote My First Tutorial!
---

It's been a long time coming, but I finally
did it - I wrote a [tutorial](http://blastzonestudios.com/tutorial/2015/02/17/intro-to-jekyll/)! I've kept putting it off because its been so tough getting started. That's what I along with many other people have issues with. Once you get rolling creating something, it just seems to flow pretty naturally. After I finished, I was left wondering why I didn't do this sooner.

I have a ton of projects that I really need to get started on. Theres so many things that I want to do and I keep forgetting such a simple concept - to just start. It's easy to get forget about a project when other distractions get your attention. Lets face it; being lazy doesn't require much work.

When I just started typing a few bits of the tutorial, it felt easy continuing. It seems like the hardest part of anything is just getting started. But after you get past that hurdle, its smooth sailing!

On a related note, this [reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) has inspired me to keep working towards my goals every single day no matter how little it is. So far this year it's been the case, which is great, but it's still only February. Let's not have anymore zero days!
