#How Bugs Can Help

I'm writing this now because I literally spent the entire day trying to fix one
bug that affected the [Blast Zone Studios](http://blastzonestudios.com) website.
After I finally figured out how to fix it, I began to thinking about bugs in general.
Yes bugs definitely suck. Bugs can take hours and hours to fix, which can
completely take over a work day(as shown today), but I try to look on the bright
side of things. I learn a ton from bugs. Moreso then just reading. I usually
go into a project thinking I know how a particular framework works. But after
I come across a bug, it really gets me to dive completely into it.

I end up looking over every resource I can possibly image to fix the issue,
which opens up the door to other topics within the particular framework. It ends
up creating a sort of wikipedia-like affect that gets me clicking on a bunch of
links to read. Bugs are inevitable. It's best to look at the bright side!
