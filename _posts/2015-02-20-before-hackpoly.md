title: Right Before Hackpoly
---

So I'm sitting here outside a Starbucks waiting to go to [Hackpoly](https://www.hackpoly.com/). I wasn't sure if I was going to go or not because I got added from the waitlist last minute. I was kind of hesitant at first because my schedule is already pretty insane as is. I started school this week, I'm helping a buddy move and I'm going to meet my cousin to talk about a website he wanted to make.

In a few hours, my body is going to hate me for getting a lack of sleep, but it's what I need to do in order to get everything done. I need to cycle doing this and being healthy 90% the rest of the time. I'm not exactly getting younger, so I seriously need to take care of myself.

I will most likely attend [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/) in early March. For students, it's only $75 for a Friday. This pretty much only happens once a year so I don't want to miss my opportunity. The trip might be pretty costly, so I need to budget correctly if I want to pay the bills this month.

I'm really excited for the next few weeks ahead. It's going to be a mix of professional and social events. I just need to finish my homework first...
