#Unreal Gamejam Post-mortem

I just completed my [project](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8jncnv83b1r8usp/AAAxbA5c302zr_H1oFXNHFtra?dl=0) for the Unreal Gamejam! That last day
was pretty rough because I had so many bugs I put off from the previous days. I had to cut out a lot of the things I wanted to add
just so the game could be presentable. I was able to get the core gameplay working, but that was it. Finishing the proper gameloop 
and displaying the score would've dramatically upped the replay value of this game, but I'm not too disappointed about how it turned 
out. I learned a ton more about Unreal 4 just by going through the process from start to finish. 

[Blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/index.html) have made the overall dev experience really 
enjoyable. I'm still not too comfortable with it yet, so I'll continue to play around with it. There were some parts of the project
where I had the idea of an implementation in C++, but I couldn't figure out how to do it with blueprints. That kind of goes along 
with any new system, where you could pull from previous experience, but not let it pigeonhole you. I'm sure in time, I'll be
thinking in blueprints!

This gamejam was definitely a good warmup for the next few events coming up this month. Can't wait!
