title: I Forgot the Oatmeal
---

Ever since school started, my schedule has been hectic to say the least. The classes I'm taking are challenging, my responsibilities to my websites are still there and I still have these pet projects I want to keep working on. I don't want to skimp out on any of those things, so I end up having to cut down on my leisure time. It's amazing how much time I can reclaim just by cutting down on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) usage.

With the added amount of responsibilities, it seems my normal habit of just remembering to do things will no longer suffice. I'm going to have to pull out my old to-do app because there's just too many things to remember at this point. Here's what happened the other day; after a long day of studying and going to classes, I go home, do my night routine and head to bed. When I woke up to do my morning routine which involves showering a breakfast, I realized I had forgotten to get the oatmeal I planned to the night before.

Yeah, this is a small, insignificant thing. People forget stuff all the time. However, this was a wake up call for me as it reminded me that I need to get organized. This is looking to be my busiest semester yet, so winging it is definitely a no-no. The day just isn't the same without oatmeal.
