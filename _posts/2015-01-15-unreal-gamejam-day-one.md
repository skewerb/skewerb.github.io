title: Unreal Gamejam

I'm about to start working on my project for the [Unreal Engine 4 gamejam](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?56004-JANUARY-GAME-JAM-Theme-BACK-TO-SQUARE-ONE). It
seems like they have it every month, so I'm hoping this becomes a a regular thing
for me to put my gamedev skills to use! The theme for this one is "Back to Square One".
My initial thought was to create a rogue-like game as starting over is part of
the mechanics. I want to keep making VR apps, so this one will definitely include.
Unreal Engine for the most part makes it really easy to hook up games to VR. Every
month Epic adds new features that make the overall development for VR smoother. I'll
go into detail of Unity and Unreal in a future blog post, but for now, I'd like to
say I'm really enjoying working with Unreal at the moment. It's just so powerful!

For the past few days, I've been working on an UE4 template that we could use for Blast Zone Studios.
 I put it up on [Github](https://github.com/skewerb/UE4_BZS_Template) today, so feel free
 to try it out! There are definitely still some bugs, but it includes some basic menus that
 aren't included in the other templates.
