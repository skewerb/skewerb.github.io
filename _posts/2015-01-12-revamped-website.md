# Revamped Website

After a long time coming, I've finally gotten around to updating my website.
Before, I was using [about.me](http://about.me). The service looked pretty nice,
but it wasn't free. I got a one year pass through [github's student pack](https://education.github.com/pack) along
with other free subscriptions. Looking at this longterm, I would much prefer
a free solution, so I decided to switch over to github pages. I was able to
get [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) up and running to power this blog. Seems really good so far.

This site will definitely be a work-in-progress, but I'm happy with what I've
come up with so far. I'm going to focus more on pushing out content from here on
out, so look forward to in-depth articles!
